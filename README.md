## Rationale
Linux manual pages are lovely. They are concise, well-written, complete, and
downright useful. However, the standard way of accessing them from the
command-line hasn't changed since the early days.

Qman aims to change that. It's a modern, full-featured manual page viewer
featuring hyperlinks, web browser like navigation, a table of contents for each
page, incremental search, on-line help, and more. It also strives to be fast and
tiny, so that it can be used everywhere. For this reason, it's been written in
plain C and has only minimal dependencies.

## Features
- Index page that displays all manual pages available on the system, sorted
  alphabetically and organised by section
- Pages for apropos and whatis results
- Hyperlinks to other manual pages
- Hyperlinks for URLs and email addresses
- In-page hyperlinks
- A table of contents for each manual page
- Incremental search for manual pages
- Incremental free page text search
- Command-line options similar to those of `man` (most importantly, `-k` and
  `-f`)
- Keyboard mappings similar to those of `less`
- Mouse support
- Navigation history
- On-line help
- Fully configurable using INI-style config files
- Manual page

## Project status 
All basic functionality has been completed. The software has been in use for
over a year now, and should considered stable. Bugs may still arise, of course,
and should be reported using the [issues](https://github.com/plp13/qman/issues)
page.

## New in this version

Version 1.4.0 introduces the following:
- A new configuration subsystem that provides an `include` directive, allowing
  Qman's configuration to be broken into multiple files
- A basic config file, `qman.conf`, together with a number of 'theme' config
  files, are now installed by default at `/etc/xdg/qman`. This gives Qman a
  handsome default look and feel.
- `hinit` is no longer a dependency
- Qman reconfigures itself on-the-fly upon receiving SIGUSR1. This is useful for
  integrating with programs such as [darkman](https://darkman.whynothugo.nl/).
- Support for manual pages compressed using `xz`
- Improved clipboard support when using the `ghostty` terminal
- Option `-A`/`--action` lets the user specify a program action to be performed
  upon startup
- Miscellaneous bug fixes and documentation updates

Version 1.4.1 fixes a few bugs introduced with the on-the-fly reconfiguration
feature, and a build failure when using `musl-libc`. It also includes some
minor documentation updates.

Version 1.4.2 fixes a compiler error with `gcc` 14.

Version 1.4.3 fixes a potential crash when resizing the terminal window.

## Downloading
Clone the [main](https://github.com/plp13/qman/tree/main) branch, which contains
Qman's latest stable version:

```
$ git clone -b main https://github.com/plp13/qman qman
```

[Tagged releases](https://github.com/plp13/qman/tags) with tarballs are also
available, starting with version 1.2.1.

## Dependencies
Qman is written in plain C, and thus requires a compiler such as `gcc` or
`clang`, together with the `meson` build system. `cog`, [a Python program for
generating C code](https://pypi.org/project/cogapp/), is also required.

The program's minimum library dependencies are `glibc` and `ncurses`.

There are also a number of optional library dependencies:
- `zlib`: support for manual pages compressed with `gzip`
- `bzip2`: support for manual pages compressed with `bzip2`
- `liblzma`: support for manual pages compressed with `xz`
- `cunit`: used for unit testing

Note that Qman is a front-end to GNU `man`, and therefore requires `man`,
`apropos`, `whatis`, and `groff` to be installed. In order for it to make sense,
a Unix manual pages database must also be present.

## Building and installing
Make sure that the minimum dependencies are installed, and do the following:

```
$ meson setup build/
$ cd build/
$ meson compile
$ sudo meson install
```

> **:bulb: Note**
>
> If using an older version of `meson`, you may need to substitute the
> aforementioned `meson compile` command with `ninja`

### Meson options

If building for an embedded system, the following optional arguments can be
passed to `meson setup`, to disable certain program features that are enabled by
default:
- `-Dman-pages=disabled`: do not install the manual page
- `-Ddocs=disabled`: do not install any documentation
- `-Dconfig=disabled`: do not install any configuration files
- `-Dgzip=disabled`: disable support for manual pages compressed with `gzip`
- `-Dbzip2=disabled`: disable support for manual pages compressed with `bzip2`
- `-Dlzma=disabled`: disable support for manual pages compressed with `xz`

Similarly, the arguments below can be used to enable features that are disabled
by default:
- `-Dtests=enabled`: enable unit testing

Finally, the options below can be used to specify alternative installation
paths:
- `-Dconfigdir=...`: where to install configuration files
- `-Ddocdir=...`: where to install documentation

### Packages
Arch Linux: packages [qman](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qman) and
[qman-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qman-git) (which follows
[devel](https://github.com/plp13/qman/tree/devel) are available on AUR

Gentoo Linux: package
[app-misc/qman](https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/proj/guru.git/tree/app-misc/qman)
is available on GURU

Packagers for other operating systems are always welcome. To get started, please
look at [PACKAGING.md](PACKAGING.md), which provides guidance on how to build
Qman on some popular Linux distributions.

If you have created a package, let me know and I'll add it to this list.

## Troubleshooting
Always make sure you are up-to-date with the
[main](https://github.com/plp13/qman/tree/main) branch. And, of course, RTFM:

```
$ qman qman
```

> **:question: What is the location of the configuration file?**

`~/.config/qman/qman.conf` (user-specific) or `/etc/xdg/qman/qman.conf`
(system-wide).

> **:question: Calling `qman` without any parameters fails with message
> `Apropos '': nothing appropriate`**

Your system does not have a manual page index cache. This can be fixed by
running (as root):

```
# mandb
```

> **:question:: Some pages don't appear in the index page, or in the dialogs
> used for opening pages or performing whatis/apropos**

Again, this is probably a `mandb` issue. Qman uses the `apropos` command to
build the array of manual pages that these features use, and `apropos` relies on
`mandb` being correctly configured and up-to-date. If it isn't, the
array will be incomplete and/or inaccurate.

Check your `man_db.conf` for correctness, and run `mandb` again as described
above. You may also want build a script that automatically runs `mandb`
after software updates, if your O/S distribution doesn't already do this.

> **:question: I'm unable to copy text to the clipboard using the mouse, and/or
> my mouse behaves erratically**

Mouse support is experimental, and depends on features that are not fully
implemented by all terminals. If you are having trouble with the mouse,
you can disable mouse support by commenting out the following lines in your
config file:

```
; [mouse]
; enable=true
```

> **:question: Trying to open an HTTP or e-mail link causes the program to
> terminate (or does nothing)**

By default, Qman uses `xdg-open` to open such links. On desktop Linux systems,
this is sufficient to open them using the default browser / email client. On
other systems, you may need to specify alternative programs using the
`browser_path` and `mailer_path` options in the `misc` section your config file,
for example:

```
[misc]
browser_path=/usr/bin/links
mailer_path=/usr/bin/mutt
```

To avoid opening such links altogether, set both options to a command that does
nothing, e.g. `/usr/bin/false`.

> **:question: I don't like the way Qman looks**

Use a different one of the supplied
[themes](https://github.com/plp13/qman/config/themes). Or build your own (and
open a pull request to to add it to the repository).

> **:question: It doesn't work on my non-Linux O/S (MacOS, FreeBSD, etc.)**

Qman is specific to Linux, built upon the GNU `man` toolchain. Ports to other
operating systems are possible. However, they'd most probably require a
non-trivial amount of effort. They'd also need to be done as separate forks.

## Contributing

[devel](https://github.com/plp13/qman/tree/devel) branch:

You should also take a look at [TESTING.md](TESTING.md), which describes the
procedures and tools we use for testing.
